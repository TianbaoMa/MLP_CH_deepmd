# DeePMD model for simulations of CH materials
[graph_CH.pb](https://github.com/TianbaoMa/MLP_CH_deepmd/blob/main/graph_CH.pb) - DeePMD trained machine learning potential model for simulations of properties of CH materials, especially finetuned for deposition, friction and fracture processes of hydrogenated carbon materials.

For more efficient MD simulations, the model can be compressed by [DeePMD-kit](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/).

For more information about the datasets, training procedure and test of the model, please refer to our article: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-025-01629-y.
